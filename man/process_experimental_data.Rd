\title{Process Experimental Data}
\usage{
process_experimental_data(experimental_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{experimental_data}{A data frame containing the experimental data with columns for protein,
gene, peptide, residue, fold change (FC), and phosphorylation site (Residue.Both).}
}
\value{
A data frame with processed experimental data, where entries with multiple phosphorylation
sites are expanded into separate rows, fold change values are transformed to log2 scale,
and unnecessary NA rows are removed.
}
\description{
Preprocesses experimental data by replacing zeroes in the FC (fold change) column with NA,
splitting entries with multiple phosphorylation sites, and calculating the log2 of fold changes.
}
