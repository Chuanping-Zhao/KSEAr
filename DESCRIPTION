Description: This package provides tools for performing Kinase Substrate Enrichment Analysis (KSEA) in proteomics data, 
    based on methodologies from the KSEA App (Version: 1.0, February 2017). KSEA is a computational method 
    designed to assess kinase activity from phosphoproteomics data, allowing comparison of kinase activities 
    between different conditions, such as control and drug-treated groups. The package integrates quantitative 
    phosphoproteomics data with kinase-substrate relationships to identify kinases that are significantly 
    activated or inhibited, applies statistical tests for enrichment analysis, and offers visualization tools 
    for the results. This tool facilitates the understanding of key regulatory mechanisms in cellular signaling 
    pathways and the functional impact of treatments or genetic alterations. The source code is inspired by and 
    adapted from the KSEA App, which can be accessed at https://casecpb.shinyapps.io/ksea/.
